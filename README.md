# taptap

A touch game for dogs and cats

## Game Ideas

- [x] Only one slot with image at the time
- [x] Like above but image appears suddenly and goes away, random delay
- [ ] All have image, only one is correct (how can they know?)
- [ ] Make a sound, must click image of that sound (like above)
- [x] Make a sound pad with many buttons
- [ ] Have a still ball (or similar), when tapped it bounces
- [ ] Maybe show 3 changing, random each with a sound, see which one is picked more
