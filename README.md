# taptap

A touch game for dogs and cats

## Game Ideas

- Only one slot with image at the time
- Like above but image appears suddenly and goes away, random delay
- All have image, only one is correct (how can they know?)
- Make a sound, must click image of that sound (like above)
- Make a sound pad with many buttons
- Have a still ball (or similar), when tapped it bounces
- Maybe show 3 changing, random each with a sound, see which one is picked more
